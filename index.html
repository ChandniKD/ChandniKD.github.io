    <p>I'm an early-stage researcher and PhD candidate at the University of Siena, Italy. My research interests are mainly focused around economy-ecology configurations. My PhD dissertation can be summarized as an exploration of alternative formalization practices when it comes to ecological processes and economic production. In this way, I hope to have strengthened the field of Ecological Economics in showing that different mathemization practices are possible. Other research interests include ecological macroeconomics, environmental justice, degrowth, just transitions and food value chains. Given that my PhD dissertation was very theoretical, I aspire to engage more in quantative analyses with respect to the aforementioned research areas. </p>
