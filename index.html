    <p> I'm an early-stage researcher and Lecturer at the <a href="https://www.soas.ac.uk/economics/" target ="_blank">Department of Economics</a> at <a href="https://www.soas.ac.uk/" target="_blank">SOAS University London</a>. I consider myself an transdisciplinary economist with a particular focus on Ecological Economics. This transdisciplinarity reflects itself in the way my research addresses various ecological issues (e.g. climate change) through the lens of Microeconomics, Macroeconomics, Economic Theory and History of Economic Thought. </p>
    <p> My theoretical work (in progress) builds on the intersection between Ecological Marxism and Economics and its implications for labour, working conditions, consumption patterns and socio-ecological reproduction. More applied work considers the domestic and foreign socio-economic consequences of low-carbon transition policies in Global North countries. Other research interests include computational analyses, Sraffa & Ecological Economics and gender and time-use. </p>
