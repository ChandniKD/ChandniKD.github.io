   <p> I'm an early-stage researcher and a Postdoctoral Fellow at the <a href="https://www.soas.ac.uk/economics/" target ="_blank">Department of Economics</a> at <a href="https://www.soas.ac.uk/" target="_blank">SOAS University London</a>. My research interests are mainly focused on Ecological Economics. My PhD dissertation represents an exploration of alternative formalization practices when it comes to ecological processes and economic production. In this way, I hope to have strengthened the field of Ecological Economics in showing that different mathemization practices are possible. Other research interests include ecological macroeconomics, environmental justice, degrowth, just transitions and food value chains. Given that my PhD dissertation was very theoretical, I aspire to engage more in quantative analyses with respect to the aforementioned research areas. </p>
