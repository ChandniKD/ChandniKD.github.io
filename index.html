<h1>Chandni Dwarkasing</h1>

<p> I'm an early-stage researcher and Ph.D. candidate at the University of Siena, Italy. My research interests are mainly focused around economy-ecology configurations. The research over the course of my Ph.D. program can be summarized as an exploration of alternative formalization practices when it comes to ecological processes and economic production. In this way, I hope to have strengthened the field of Ecological Economics in providing an alternative to prevailing mathemization practices. </p>

<p> Other research interests include Ecological Macroeconomics, Environmental Justice, Degrowth, Just Transitions and Food Value Chains. Given that the research I have conducted during my Ph.D. was mostly theoretical, I aspire to engage more in quantative analyses with respect to the aforementioned research areas. </p>
