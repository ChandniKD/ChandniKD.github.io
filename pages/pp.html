<p>I spent a 6 month visiting period at <a href="https://www.uab.cat/icta/" target="_blank">ICTA-UAB</a> in Barcelona, Spain. Under the supervision of Federico Demaria, I took part of the Environmental Justice <a href="http://www.envjustice.org/" target="_blank">(ENVJUSTICE)</a>  group led by Joan Martinez-Allier. My task was to write case studies for the Environmental Justice atlas on the informal recycling sector in the MENA region. A record of all the cases entered on waste privatisation/wastepicker conflicts can be found <a href="https://ejatlas.org/type/waste-privatisation-conflicts-waste-picker-access-to-waste" target="_blank">here</a>. </p>

<p>As a MSc student at CAU Kiel, I was employed as a student research assistant at the <a href="https://www.ifr.uni-kiel.de/en?set_language=en" target="_blank">Institute for Environmental, Resource and Spatial Economics</a>. Under the supervision of Kira Lancker, I was in charge of the organization and cleaning of survey data of West-African coastal fishermen. The surveys were conducted under the EU-funded <a href="https://preface.w.uib.no/" target="_blank">PREFACE Project</a>. </p>

<p>As part of my MSc curriculum, together with my colleague at that time, Chiara Signoria, I set up an informal video blog series called <a href="https://unravellingsystems.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Unravelling Systems</a>. Our aim was to highlight the relationship between ecological and financial systems in a casual, but nevertheless, educational manner. The videoblog consists of videos in which we clarify related scientific literature as well as interviews with experts. </p>
