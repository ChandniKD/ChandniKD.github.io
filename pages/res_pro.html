<h1>Work-in-progress</h1>

<ul>
  <li>I'm working on condensing the final chapter of my dissertation, <i> A computational approach to the metabolic rift in a 3-sector Sraffian framework </i>, into a comprehensible and straighforward working paper. In the chapter I formally describe and simulate the relationship between distribution, exploitation and ecological degradation from a neo-Ricardian/Sraffian vantage point. I want to simplify the current model and clean up the code such that anyone is able to freely use it. The analytical component of the paper will be used to propose a heterodox alternative to the formal depiction of economy-ecology configurations. </li>
  <li>Another research area I'm interested in the implication of degrowth in the global North, where the movement is gaining more and more traction, for the global South. Assuming the implementation of degrowth policies in developed economies, the related reduction of either the consumption or production of certain commodity groups has relevant repercussions for emerging and export-led economies. Such repercussions can be related to competive advantages and losses which bear implications for respective nations' balance of payment and financial stability. </li>
  <li>Finally, I'm part of the <a href="https://ecoesione.ec.unipi.it/" target="_blank">Ecoesione</a> research group as a doctoral student. I moderate a reading group on <a href="https://ecoesione.ec.unipi.it/reading-group/" target="_blank"><i> The social limits to the ecological transition </i></a> where participants from various research fields are able to present papers which are relevant to broaded our knowledge on the topic. </li>
</ul> 

<h1>Previous projects</h1>

<ul>
  <li>I spent a 6 month visiting period at <a href="https://www.uab.cat/icta/" target="_blank">ICTA-UAB</a> in Barcelona, Spain. Under the supervision of Federico Demaria, I took part of the Environmental Justice <a href="http://www.envjustice.org/" target="_blank">(ENVJUSTICE)</a>  group led by Joan Martinez-Allier. My task was to write case studies for the Environmental Justice atlas on the informal recycling sector in the MENA region. A record of all the cases entered on waste privatisation/wastepicker conflicts can be found <a href="https://ejatlas.org/type/waste-privatisation-conflicts-waste-picker-access-to-waste" target="_blank">here</a>. </li>
  <li>As a MSc student at CAU Kiel, I was employed as a student research assistant at the <a href="https://www.ifr.uni-kiel.de/en?set_language=en" target="_blank">Institute for Environmental, Resource and Spatial Economics</a>. Under the supervision of Kira Lancker, I was in charge of the organization and cleaning of survey data of West-African coastal fishermen. The surveys were conducted under the EU-funded <a href="https://preface.w.uib.no/" target="_blank">PREFACE Project</a>. </li>
  <li>As part of my MSc curriculum, together with my colleague at that time, Chiara Signoria, I set up an informal video blog series called <a href="https://unravellingsystems.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Unravelling Systems</a>. Our aim was to highlight the relationship between ecological and financial systems in a casual, but nevertheless, educational manner. The videoblog consists of videos in which we clarify related scientific literature as well as interviews with experts. </li>
