<h1>Work-in-progress</h1>


<p>I'm working on condensing the final chapter of my dissertation, <i> A computational approach to the metabolic rift in a 3-sector Sraffian framework </i>, into a comprehensible and straighforward working paper. In the chapter I formally describe and simulate the relationship between distribution, exploitation and ecological degradation from a neo-Ricardian/Sraffian vantage point. I want to simplify the current model and clean up the code such that anyone is able to freely use it. The analytical component of the paper will be used to propose a heterodox alternative to the formal depiction of economy-ecology configurations. </p>

<p>Another research area I'm interested in the implication of degrowth in the global North, where the movement is gaining more and more traction, for the global South. Assuming the implementation of degrowth policies in developed economies, the related reduction of either the consumption or production of certain commodity groups has relevant repercussions for emerging and export-led economies. Such repercussions can be related to competive advantages and losses which bear implications for respective nations' balance of payment and financial stability. </p>

<p>Finally, I'm part of the <a href="https://ecoesione.ec.unipi.it/" target="_blank">Ecoesione</a> research group as a doctoral student. I moderate a reading group on <a href="https://ecoesione.ec.unipi.it/reading-group/" target="_blank"><i> The social limits to the ecological transition </i></a> where participants from various research fields are able to present papers which are relevant to broaded our knowledge on the topic. </p>
