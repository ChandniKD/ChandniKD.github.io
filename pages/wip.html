<h1>Work-in-progress</h1>


<p>I'm working on condensing the final chapter of my dissertation, <i> A computational approach to the metabolic rift in a 3-sector Sraffian framework</i>, into a comprehensible and straighforward working paper and publication. In this chapter I formally describe and simulate the relationship between distribution, exploitation and ecological degradation from a neo-Ricardian vantage point. </p>

<p>Another research area I'm interested in is the implication of low-carbon transition policies in the global North (e.g. the EU Green Deal), for the global South. Policies which induce reductions in either the consumption or production of certain commodity groups bear relevant repercussions for emerging and export-led economies. Such repercussions can be related to competive advantages and losses which have implications for respective nations' balance of payment and financial stability. </p>
